## Authentication (Optional)

Want more requests? Add Reddit credentials to your Claude Desktop config:

### Setup Steps

1. **Go to** https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. **Click** "Create App" or "Create Another App"
3. **Fill out the form:**
   - **Name**: Any name (e.g., "reddit-mcp-buddy")
   - **App type**: Select **"script"** (CRITICAL for 100 rpm!)
   - **Description**: Optional
   - **About URL**: Leave blank
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8080` (required but unused)
4. **Click** "Create app"
5. **Find your credentials:**
   - **Client ID**: The string under "personal use script"
   - **Client Secret**: The secret string
6. **Update your Claude Desktop config:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "reddit": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "reddit-mcp-buddy"],
      "env": {
        "REDDIT_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret",
        "REDDIT_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "REDDIT_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Three-Tier Authentication System

Reddit MCP Buddy supports three authentication levels, each with different rate limits:

| Mode | Rate Limit | Required Credentials | Best For |
|------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Anonymous** | 10 req/min | None | Testing, light usage |
| **App-Only** | 60 req/min | Client ID + Secret | Regular browsing |
| **Authenticated** | 100 req/min | All 4 credentials | Heavy usage, automation |

#### How It Works:
- **Anonymous Mode**: Default mode, no setup required, uses public Reddit API
- **App-Only Mode**: Uses OAuth2 client credentials grant (works with both script and web apps)
- **Authenticated Mode**: Uses OAuth2 password grant (requires script app type)

**Important Notes**:
- Script apps support BOTH app-only (60 rpm) and authenticated (100 rpm) modes
- Web apps only support app-only mode (60 rpm maximum)
- For 100 requests/minute, you MUST use a script app with username + password

## Privacy & Data Handling

Reddit MCP Buddy is designed with privacy and transparency in mind. Here's how your data is handled:

### Data Collection
- **Reddit API Data**: The server fetches public Reddit content (posts, comments, user profiles) through Reddit's official API
- **No Tracking**: We don't collect, store, or transmit any analytics, telemetry, or usage data
- **No Third Parties**: All data flows directly between your machine, Reddit's API, and your AI assistant

### Local Storage
- **Authentication Credentials** (optional):
  - Stored locally in `~/.reddit-mcp-buddy/auth.json` when using `--auth` CLI setup
  - Passwords are **never** written to disk - only used in-memory for OAuth token exchange
  - Environment variables (recommended for Claude Desktop) are never persisted by this server
- **Cache Data**:
  - Reddit API responses are temporarily cached in memory to improve performance
  - Cache size limited to 50MB maximum
  - All cache data is cleared when the server stops
  - Can be disabled with `REDDIT_BUDDY_NO_CACHE=true`

### Data Transmission
- **Reddit API Only**: Your credentials are only sent to Reddit's official OAuth endpoints (`https://oauth.reddit.com` and `https://www.reddit.com`)
- **No External Services**: No data is sent to any other external services, analytics platforms, or third parties
- **Local Processing**: All data processing happens locally on your machine

### Security Notes
- **Read-Only Operations**: All tools are read-only - the server never posts, comments, or modifies any Reddit content
- **Credential Safety**:
  - OAuth tokens are stored in memory and refreshed automatically
  - Client secrets are treated as sensitive and never logged
  - Use environment variables in Claude Desktop config for maximum security
- **Open Source**: Full source code is available at https://github.com/karanb192/reddit-mcp-buddy for security auditing

### GDPR & Privacy Compliance
- **No Personal Data Collection**: We don't collect or process any personal data beyond what's necessary to authenticate with Reddit's API
- **User Control**: You control all credentials and can delete `~/.reddit-mcp-buddy/auth.json` at any time
- **Right to Erasure**: Simply delete the auth file or uninstall the server to remove all local data

### Questions or Concerns?
If you have any privacy questions or concerns, please [open an issue](https://github.com/karanb192/reddit-mcp-buddy/issues) on GitHub.

## Testing & Development

### Testing Your Rate Limits

Reddit MCP Buddy includes comprehensive testing tools to verify your authentication is working correctly:

```bash
# Clone the repository first
git clone https://github.com/karanb192/reddit-mcp-buddy.git
cd reddit-mcp-buddy
npm install

# Test with your current environment settings
npm run test:rate-limit

# Test specific authentication modes
npm run test:rate-limit:anon    # Test anonymous mode (10 rpm)
npm run test:rate-limit:app     # Test app-only mode (60 rpm)
npm run test:rate-limit:auth    # Test authenticated mode (100 rpm)
```

The rate limit tester will:
- Start a local server instance
- Make rapid API requests to test rate limits
- Display a real-time progress bar
- Confirm which authentication tier you're using
- Show exactly when rate limiting kicks in

### Interactive Authentication Setup (for local testing only)

For local development and testing, you can set up authentication interactively:
```bash
npx -y reddit-mcp-buddy --auth
```

This will prompt you for Reddit app credentials and save them locally. **Note: This does NOT work with Claude Desktop** - use environment variables in your Claude config instead.

### Testing with HTTP Mode

To test the server directly in your terminal:
```bash
# Run in HTTP mode on port 3000
npx -y reddit-mcp-buddy --http

# Or with custom port
REDDIT_BUDDY_PORT=8080 npx -y reddit-mcp-buddy --http
```

**Note:** The server runs in stdio mode by default (for Claude Desktop). Use `--http` flag for testing with Postman MCP or direct API calls.

### Global Install
```bash
npm install -g reddit-mcp-buddy
reddit-buddy --http  # For testing
```

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karanb192/reddit-mcp-buddy.git
cd reddit-mcp-buddy
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

### Using Docker
```bash
docker run -it karanb192/reddit-mcp-buddy
```

### Claude Desktop Extension

For one-click installation in Claude Desktop, download the pre-built extension:

**📦 [Download reddit-mcp-buddy.mcpb](https://github.com/karanb192/reddit-mcp-buddy/releases/latest/download/reddit-mcp-buddy.mcpb)**

**Installation:** Simply open the downloaded `.mcpb` file - Claude Desktop will automatically install the extension and the Reddit tools will be immediately available.

#### Build from Source (Optional)

If you prefer to build the extension yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karanb192/reddit-mcp-buddy.git
cd reddit-mcp-buddy
./scripts/build-mcpb.sh
```

**Note**: The Desktop Extension format is currently in preview (September 2025). Most users should use the standard npm installation method shown in [Quick Start](#quick-start-30-seconds).

## Comparison with Other Tools

| **Zero Setup** | ✅ Works instantly | ❌ Requires API keys |
| **Max Rate Limit** | ✅ 100 req/min proven | ❓ Unverified claims |
| **Language** | TypeScript/Node.js | Python (most) |
| **Tools Count** | 5 (focused) | 8-10 (redundant) |
| **Fake Metrics** | ✅ Real data only | ❌ "Sentiment scores" |
| **Search** | ✅ Full search | Limited or none |
| **Caching** | ✅ Smart caching | Usually none |
| **LLM Optimized** | ✅ Clear params | Confusing options |
| **Rate Limit Testing** | ✅ Built-in tools | ❌ No verification |

## Rate Limits

|------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Anonymous | 10 | 15 min | None |
| App-only | 60 | 5 min | Client ID + Secret |
| Authenticated | 100 | 5 min | All credentials |

## Why Reddit MCP Buddy?

### What others do wrong:
- ❌ **Fake metrics** - "sentiment scores" that are just keyword counting
- ❌ **Complex setup** - Requiring API keys just to start
- ❌ **Bloated responses** - Returning 100+ fields of Reddit's raw API
- ❌ **Poor LLM integration** - Confusing parameters and unclear descriptions

### What we do right:
- ✅ **Real data only** - If it's not from Reddit's API, we don't make it up
- ✅ **Clean responses** - Only the fields that matter
- ✅ **Clear parameters** - LLMs understand exactly what to send
- ✅ **Fast & cached** - Responses are instant when possible

## Examples

### Your AI can now answer:

**"What are the top posts about GPT-4 today?"**
```
→ search_reddit with query="GPT-4", time="day", sort="top"
```

**"Show me what's trending in technology"**
```
→ browse_subreddit with subreddit="technology", sort="hot"
```

**"What do people think about this article?"**
```
→ search_reddit with the article URL to find discussions
```

**"Analyze the user DeepFuckingValue"**
```
→ user_analysis with username="DeepFuckingValue"
```

**"Get the comments from this Reddit post"**
```
→ get_post_details with url="https://reddit.com/r/..."
```

**"What's trending across all of Reddit?"**
```
→ browse_subreddit with subreddit="all", sort="hot"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Can't achieve 100 requests/minute"**
- Ensure your app type is **"script"** not "web" or "installed"
- Script apps created by one account can only authenticate as that same account
- Run `npm run test:rate-limit:auth` to verify (requires cloning the repo)
- If still failing, create a new script app while logged into the authenticating account

**"Command not found" error**
```bash
# Ensure npm is installed
node --version
npm --version

# Try with full npx path
$(npm bin -g)/reddit-mcp-buddy
```

**Rate limit errors**
- Without auth: Limited to 10 requests/minute
- With app credentials only: 60 requests/minute
- With full authentication: 100 requests/minute
- Solution: Add Reddit credentials (see [Authentication](#authentication-optional))

**"Subreddit not found"**
- Check spelling (case-insensitive)
- Some subreddits may be private or quarantined
- Try "all" or "popular" instead

**Connection issues**
- Reddit may be down (check https://www.redditstatus.com)
- Firewall blocking requests
- Try restarting the MCP server

### Environment Variables

#### Authentication Variables
| Variable | Description | Required | Rate Limit |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` | Reddit app client ID | No | 60 req/min (with secret) |
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Reddit app secret | No | 60 req/min (with ID) |
| `REDDIT_USERNAME` | Reddit account username | No | 100 req/min (with all 4) |
| `REDDIT_PASSWORD` | Reddit account password | No | 100 req/min (with all 4) |
| `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` | User agent string | No | - |

#### Server Configuration
| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `REDDIT_BUDDY_HTTP` | Run as HTTP server instead of stdio | `false` |
| `REDDIT_BUDDY_PORT` | HTTP server port (when HTTP=true) | `3000` |
| `REDDIT_BUDDY_NO_CACHE` | Disable caching (always fetch fresh) | `false` |

## Technical Details

### Smart Caching System

Reddit MCP Buddy includes intelligent caching to improve performance and reduce API calls:

- **Memory Safe**: Hard limit of 50MB - won't affect your system performance
- **Adaptive TTLs**: Hot posts (5min), New posts (2min), Top posts (30min)
- **LRU Eviction**: Automatically removes least-used data when approaching limits
- **Hit Tracking**: Optimizes cache based on actual usage patterns

This means faster responses and staying well within Reddit's rate limits, all while using minimal system resources.
